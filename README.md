This is a stupid idea to make a interpreter program with html.
HTML+ plan:
So this is gonna be similar to html but diffrent and maybe simpler ways of doing hard things
HTML+ basic elements:
1 <text> this will display text at diffrent sizes. fs means font size. t means text <text t="test" fs="12">
2 <pic> will display a image. <pic id="id">
3 <vid> will display a video <vid id="id">
4 <upload> will bring up file explore to select a file to upload <upload type="mp4" id="id">
5 <download> will download <download id="id">
6 <frame> will display HTML+ code within HTML+ code <frame file="test.html+"> or <frame url="https://website.com">
7 <button> simple enough <button t="test" id="id">
8 <idset> id set will set id's to files <idset set="id" file="img.png">
9 <tinput> text input <tinput id="id">
10 <ext> extesion <ext url="https://website.com/file.js">

...also please tell me if you make another interpreter program within this...
